# Hello and welcome to the examples!
Here you will find a couple of examples that show some use cases of how to use the flutter fader!

## How to Run  
First you'll want to cd into the example directory.  
`cd fader_with_buttons`  
Then you'll want to run flutter create (this will generate all the android/io goodies you need to run the example on your device. I don't include them in source control for the sake of cleanliness)  
`flutter create .`  
Now you can run the example  
`flutter run` or by running from the IDE/editor of your choice!  
  
  
## Overview of examples  
### Fader with buttons  
Two buttons, pressing the top one with fade it out, and pressing the bottom one will fade the top one back in

### Fader with scroll
A very long scroll view, and a floating action button. When you scroll down the floating action button will fade out, when you scroll up it'll fade back in.
